# How to make a pull request  
* Fork the repo  
* Add new cogs/commands  
* Make a pull request explaining what you have added or changed  
  
# How to test your changes  
Testing changes by running it with the source code from this repo ***won't work*** due to it 
needing access to api-keys and passwords located outside of the repo. Instead, test your new bot
features with a seperate .py file and bot token and then add them to the fork when they are ready  
  
# Requirements  
Requirements for creating pull-requests are:  
* Use proper [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names](naming conventions)
* Don't have spaghetti code  
* Properly explain, possibly with examples, what your new commands do or how you've changed current commands  
* Don't add new commands to the main.py file  
* Comment your code
