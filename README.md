# Consumer-Your-Calcium-Discord-Bot
official discord bot for the Consume Your Calcium discord,     
providing useful tools for members and admins

## what does it do?
### Set reminders
Reminders mention users or roles after a certain amount of time  
  
To use the command in discord type:  
`//reminder @user/role time "message to be displayed"`  
    
after the given time in minutes the bot would send:  
`@user/role message to be displayed (reminder set by @user)`  
  
### Set custom prefixes  
With the custom prefix command changing the bots command prefix is much easier  
  
simply type:
`//prefix customPrefix`
